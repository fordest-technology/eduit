# Plan for Performance and Logging Fix

## 1. Problem Analysis

### Observations

- Application loads slowly, especially on initial requests.
- Terminal output is very verbose, with many Prisma queries and possibly other logs.
- Excessive logging may slow down the server and clutter debugging.

### Potential Causes

- Excessive logging (console logs, Prisma logs, etc.)
- Unoptimized database queries (N+1, missing indexes, etc.)
- Heavy initial loads (large bundles, unoptimized SSR, blocking API calls)
- Unnecessary middleware or computation
- Lack of caching
- Development mode overhead

## 2. Deep Plan of Action

### A. Logging Optimization

1. **Audit Logging Statements:**

   - Identify all `console.log`, `console.info`, `console.error`, and Prisma log settings.
   - Remove or reduce unnecessary logs, especially in production.
   - Use a logging library (e.g., pino, winston) with log levels and output control.

2. **Prisma Logging:**
   - Check Prisma client instantiation for log level settings.
   - Set Prisma to log only errors/warnings in production, and reduce query logs in development.

### B. Database Query Optimization

3. **Analyze Slow Queries:**
   - Identify endpoints with the most queries (N+1 issues, repeated queries).
   - Use Prisma’s query logging (temporarily) to profile slow queries.
   - Optimize queries: use includes, select only needed fields, batch requests, and add missing indexes.

### C. Application Performance

4. **SSR/Client Optimization:**

   - Audit Next.js pages for heavy server-side logic.
   - Use dynamic imports for large components.
   - Optimize data fetching: fetch only what’s needed, use SWR/React Query for caching.

5. **Middleware & API:**
   - Review middleware for unnecessary computation or logging.
   - Ensure API routes are not doing redundant work.

### D. Caching & Static Assets

6. **Implement Caching:**
   - Use HTTP caching for static assets and infrequently changing API responses.
   - Leverage Next.js ISR/SSG where possible.

### E. Development vs. Production

7. **Environment-Specific Logging:**
   - Ensure verbose logging is only enabled in development.
   - Production should log only errors and critical info.

## 3. Step-by-Step Execution Plan

1. **Audit and Refactor Logging:**

   - Search for all logging statements and Prisma log settings.
   - Refactor to use a proper logger with environment-based log levels.

2. **Profile and Optimize Database Queries:**

   - Temporarily enable Prisma query logging to profile slow endpoints.
   - Refactor queries to avoid N+1 and select only necessary fields.

3. **Optimize Next.js Data Fetching and SSR:**

   - Review getServerSideProps, getStaticProps, and API routes for heavy logic.
   - Use dynamic imports and code splitting.

4. **Review Middleware and API Route Logic:**

   - Remove unnecessary computation and logging.

5. **Implement/Improve Caching:**

   - Add caching headers and use Next.js ISR/SSG where appropriate.

6. **Test and Measure:**
   - Measure load times and server response before and after changes.
   - Ensure logs are concise and only show what’s necessary.
